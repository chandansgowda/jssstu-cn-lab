Program 1: Simulate a three nodes point – to – point network with duplex links
between them. Set the queue size and vary the bandwidth and find the number of
packets dropped.

Program 2: Simulate the transmission of ping messages over a network topology consisting of 6
nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.

Program 3: Simulate an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion window for different source / destination.

Program 4: Implement simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wire-less
LAN by simulation and determine the performance with respect to
transmission of packets
